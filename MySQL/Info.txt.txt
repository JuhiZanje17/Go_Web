sql:-

sql.Open():-
db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "username:password@(127.0.0.1:3308)/dbname?parseTime=true")
->Note that Open does not directly open a database connection: this is deferred until a query is made. 
To verify that a connection can be made before making a query, use the Ping function:
->Open may just validate its arguments without creating a connection to the database. To verify that the data source name is valid, call Ping.

db.Ping():-
func (db *sql.DB) Ping() error
Ping verifies a connection to the database is still alive, establishing a connection if necessary.

db.QueryRow:-
query := `SELECT id, username, password, created_at FROM users WHERE id = ?`
err := db.QueryRow(query, 1).Scan(&id, &username, &password, &createdAt)
QueryRow always returns a non-nil value. Errors are deferred until Row's Scan method is called.
 If the query selects no rows, the *Row's Scan will return ErrNoRows. 
Otherwise, the *Row's Scan scans the first selected row and discards the rest.
